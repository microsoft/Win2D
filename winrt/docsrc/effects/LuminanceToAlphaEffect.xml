      <summary>
        Generates an image with alpha channel set to the luminance of the source image, and 
        color channels set to 0. Use it to make a semitransparent overlay based on the 
        brightness of the source image.
      </summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          This effect sets the alpha channel of the output to the luminance of the input 
          image using the color matrix:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/LuminanceToAlpha.png" alt="LuminanceToAlpha diagram" />
        <p>
          This effect consumes and outputs premultiplied alpha images. It won't work on 
          straight alpha images unless they are fully opaque.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: because images are stored in a gamma-compensated format, before you calculate 
          the luminance for an image you may wish to first perform inverse gamma correction to 
          get the true color values for the image. Since images are normally stored at 2.2 
          gamma, you can use <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Effects.GammaTransferEffect"/> 
          with an exponent of (1/2.2).
