      <summary>
        Represents any object that can create graphics resources. Implemented by
        <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl"/>,
        <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice"/>, and
        <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession"/>.
      </summary>

      <remarks>
        <p>Many types of graphics resource are attached to a graphics device object. Their constructors take
           a <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice"/> parameter, so in order to create such
           a resource you must first have access to a CanvasDevice.</p>

        <p>But what if you don't have a CanvasDevice lying around handy? Much of the time, you will
           be dealing with a CanvasControl object instead. You can always get a CanvasDevice from a
           CanvasControl, so you could create resources like this:</p>

        <code>var brush = new CanvasSolidColorBrush(canvasControl.Device, Colors.OliveDrab);</code>

        <p>but it soon gets annoying having to keep typing ".Device" all over the place!</p>

        <p>For those of us with less patience, ICanvasResourceCreator allows resource constructors 
           to accept either a CanvasDevice OR a CanvasControl, so we can call them more conveniently:</p>

        <code>var brush = new CanvasSolidColorBrush(canvasControl, Colors.MistyRose);</code>

      <summary>
        Represents an object that can create graphics resources, and which has a specific DPI. Implemented by
        <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl"/> and
        <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDrawingSession"/>.
      </summary>

      <remarks>
        <p>
          Some objects (eg. <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice"/>) can be used simultaneously to draw
          at many different DPI (dots-per-inch) settings, but others (eg. <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl"/>)
          are fixed to a specific DPI. This interface represents things that have a specific DPI. When other resources
          are created from it they can automatically inherit this DPI, whereas when a resource that cares about DPI is
          created directly from a device, the DPI must be explicitly specified.

      <summary>Gets the dots-per-inch (DPI) of this object.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          DPI describes the ratio between device independent pixels (DIPs) and actual physical pixels.
          The identity DPI value is 96, which means DIPs and pixels are the same.
