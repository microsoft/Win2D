        <p>
          This size limit is reported in pixels. The limit applies to both the width and height of bitmaps.
          It will vary depending on the Direct3D feature level of the device, and whether the device
          has hardware acceleration enabled. To convert the size limit from pixels to <a href="DPI.htm">DIPs</a>, use the

          Note that even when the A8UIntNormalized, R8UIntNormalized, or R8G8UIntNormalized

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice.LowPriority" Experimental="true">
      <summary>Reduces the priority of drawing work submitted to this device.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          Low priority devices allow their drawing work to be preempted if any other, 
          normal priority devices attempt to draw at the same time. When in low priority 
          mode Direct2D may also split up drawing work into a larger number of smaller 
          batches or tiles, in order to increase the opportinuties for GPU preemption.
        </p>
          This can be useful for apps that draw to more than one device at a time, where 
          one thread does expensive, long running drawing work at the same time as the UI 
          thread or a dedicated animation thread is using a different device to update 
          the display. Setting the long running device to low priority minimizes its 
          interference with the display animation.

      <remarks>
        <p>
          If your application does not use multiple threads or Direct2D interop
          and only uses the default devices created by CanvasControl or
          CanvasAnimatedControl then you do not need to worry about any of the
          following!
        </p>
        <p>
          Win2D takes care to ensure that methods on its API can be called from
          any thread.  However, when sharing resources with non-Win2D APIs
          (using <a href="Interop.htm">Direct2D interop</a> or the interfaces
          from <a
          href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Windows.Graphics.DirectX.Direct3D11">Windows.Graphics.DirectX.Direct3D11</a>
          for example) it is important to ensure these resources are only ever
          accessed from a single thread at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          This method allows you to take out a lock on the CanvasDevice so that
          only the current thread is able to access any Win2D resources created
          from that device.  The returned object holds the lock until it is
          disposed.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, <a
          href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn891449.aspx">SoftwareBitmap.CreateCopyFromSurfaceAsync</a>
          takes a reference to an <a
          href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.graphics.directx.direct3d11.idirect3dsurface.aspx">IDirect3DSurface</a>.
          Since SoftwareBitmap is not a part of Win2D it does not know that it
          needs to use Win2D's lock when accessing the surface.  If the
          application had another thread running then these could both be
          accessing the underlying graphics device simultaneously.  This code
          shows how to do this correctly:

          <code>
            <![CDATA[
            SoftwareBitmap softwareBitmap;
            using (var lock = canvasBitmap.Device.Lock())
            {
                softwareBitmap = await SoftwareBitmap.CreateCopyFromSurfaceAsync(canvasBitmap);
            }
            ]]>
          </code>          
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Win2D is built on top of Direct2D, and inherits the threading model
          from there.  The <a
          HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/jj569217(v=vs.85).aspx">MSDN</a>
          documentation can provide additional insight beyond the quick overview
          here.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In Direct2D terms,
          <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasDevice.Lock">CanvasDevice.Lock</see>
          calls
