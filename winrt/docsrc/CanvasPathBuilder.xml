          <summary>A path builder is used for creating freeform <see cref="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasGeometry"/> objects.</summary>
        <remarks>
          Paths consist of zero or more figures, where a figure is made up of straight or curved segments. Figures can be opened or closed. 
        </remarks>
        <example>
                <p>The following is an example of how to create a simple CanvasGeometry using a CanvasPathBuilder object.</p>
                <code>
		    CanvasPathBuilder pathBuilder = new CanvasPathBuilder(device);
		    
		    pathBuilder.BeginFigure(new Vector2(1, 1));
		    pathBuilder.AddLine(300, 300);
		    pathBuilder.AddLine(1, 300);
		    pathBuilder.EndFigure(CanvasFigureLoop.Closed);
		    
		    CanvasGeometry triangleGeometry = CanvasGeometry.CreatePath(pathBuilder);
                </code>

        <summary>Specifies that self-intersecting regions are considered 'filled' based on the Alternate fill rule.</summary>
        <remarks>
        <p>
        To determine whether a point is considered filled by the path, draw a ray from that point 
        to some point obviously outside the path. Then examine the places where a segment of the path crosses the ray. 
        </p>
        <p>        
        Count how many segments that the ray crosses. If it's an odd number, the point is considered filled by the
        path. If it's an even number, it's considered not to be.
        </p>
        <p>
        Of course, this process is painstaking to evaluate by hand. Drawing and geometry operations evaluate
        the fill mode quickly.

        This option is the default.

        <p>
        To determine whether a point is considered filled by the path, draw a ray from that point 
        to some point obviously outside the path. Then examine the places where a segment of the path crosses the ray. 
        </p>
        <p>        
        Keep track of a number, starting at zero. 
        Add one for every clockwise intersection. Subtract one for every counterclockwise intersection. 
        If the result is nonzero, the point is considered inside the fill area. A zero count means that the point lies outside the fill or clip area.
