      <remarks>
        Advance width is the offset from the origin of the current glyph
        to the origin of the next glyph. When writing text horizontally,
        for example, the offset's in the X-direction.

      <summary>The offset of this glyph in the direction of the glyph run.</summary>
      <remarks>
        A positive advance offset used with left-to-right text, for example,
        will move the glyph (in pre-transform coordinates) to the right.

      <summary>The offset in the ascent direction.</summary>
      <remarks>
        The ascent direction refers to the direction that ascenders point. 
        Ascenders are features on letters such as 'b' or 'd' or 't' on Latin scripts.
        A positive ascender offset moves the glyph up (in pre-transform coordinates). 
        A negative ascender offset moves the glyph down.

      <summary>An application-implemented interface for receiving detailed rendering information about text layouts.</summary>
      <remarks>
         <p>
           Custom text renderers are used for a wide variety of purposes, such as
           <ul>
             <li>Querying the metrics of the font which is used when drawing a text layout</li>
             <li>Arbitrarily choosing the transform at which individual glyphs are drawn</li>
             <li>Controlling the visibility of certain glyphs</li>
             <li>Applying different imaging effects to different glyphs within a layout</li>
             <li>Stylizing strikethroughs and underlines</li>
           </ul>           
         </p>
         <p>
           Why is this renderer needed for knowing which font is used while drawing
           a text layout? There's a very deliberate reason why you can't simply measure 
           text using a text format alone, or even a text format plus a set of characters. 
           That reason is font fallbacks. 
         </p>
         <p>
           The font face that will ultimately get used when you draw text actually depends 
           on the text string itself, together with a multitude of other environmental 
           properties. Sounds surprising, right?  If you ask for, say, a glyph that isn't 
           in the font specified in your layout's text format, Win2D will take advantage of 
           DirectWrite's fallback logic and actually switch the font to one that has the glyph. 
           This is great for making apps that work well on a wide variety of 
           environments, but it also means the info in that text format is really just 
           a list of 'suggestions'. It's not a guarantee of which font will get used.
         </p>
         <p>
           It's impossible to make guarantees about what specific font face will be used to
           measure or draw some text, until you actually have the glyphs on hand that you're 
           trying to operate on, and the exact context in which you're using them. This is
           where ICanvasTextRenderer comes in.
         </p>
         <p>
           ICanvasTextRenderer provides a guaranteed way for an app to know what font face
           is being used for drawing a piece of text, and what the properties of that font
           face are. Apps may want to intercept DrawGlyphRun to learn about metrics for
           a piece of text, or adjust some details about the glyph run before passing
           the parameters on to 
           <see cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Text.CanvasTextLayout.DrawToTextRenderer"/>.
