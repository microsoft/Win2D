      <summary>XAML control providing immediate mode 2D rendering. Start here if you are new to the Win2D API.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          To get started using Win2D, simply add a CanvasControl to your XAML
          tree, subscribe to its CanvasControl.Draw event, and use the methods of
          CanvasDrawEventArgs.DrawingSession to draw your immediate mode 2D graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using CanvasControl from managed code, care must be 
          taken to avoid memory leaks due to reference count cycles. See 
          <a href="RefCycles.htm">Avoiding memory leaks</a> for more information.
        </p>
      </remarks>
      <example>
        <p>Starting with the "Blank App" XAML project template, edit MainPage.xaml and add the namespace and unloaded handler:</p>
        <code>
          xmlns:canvas="using:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml"
          Unloaded="Page_Unloaded"
        </code>
        <p>Add a CanvasControl to the page:</p>
        <code>
          &lt;Grid&gt;
            &lt;canvas:CanvasControl x:Name="myWidget" CreateResources="myWidget_CreateResources" Draw="myWidget_Draw" ClearColor="CornFlowerBlue"/&gt;
          &lt;/Grid&gt;
        </code>
        <p>Edit MainPage.xaml.cs, and add some drawing code:</p>
        <code>
          public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
          {
              CanvasSolidColorBrush redBrush;

              public MainPage()
              {
                  this.InitializeComponent();
              }

              void myWidget_CreateResources(CanvasControl sender, CanvasCreateResourcesEventArgs args)
              {
                  // Create any resources needed by the Draw event handler.

                  // Asynchronous work can be tracked with TrackAsyncAction:
                  args.TrackAsyncAction(myWidget_CreateResourcesAsync(sender).AsAsyncAction());
              }

              async Task myWidget_CreateResourcesAsync(CanvasControl sender)
              {
                   // Load bitmaps, create brushes, etc.
                   bitmapTiger = await CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync(sender, "imageTiger.jpg");
              }

              void myWidget_Draw(CanvasControl sender, CanvasDrawEventArgs args)
              {
                  args.DrawingSession.DrawEllipse(155, 115, 80, 30, Colors.Black, 3);
                  args.DrawingSession.DrawText("Hello, world!", 100, 100, Colors.Yellow);
              }

              void Page_Unloaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
              {
                  this.myWidget.RemoveFromVisualTree();
                  this.myWidget = null;
              }

               Calling Invalidate results in the Draw event being raised shortly afterward.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>Normally, the contents of a CanvasControl are drawn only once when it first becomes visible.
           If you want to change those contents, call Invalidate to tell the control it must redraw itself.</p>

        <p>This is a lightweight method, so it is reasonable to call it many times in rapid succession.
           High frequency calls to Invalidate will be merged, with the control only actually redrawing
           at a maximum of the display refresh rate. It will not redraw once for every Invalidate call
           if these are happening faster than the display can keep up.</p>

        <p>If you want to animate the contents of a CanvasControl, you should use
           <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasAnimatedControl"/> instead. CanvasAnimatedControl
           raises the Draw event on a configurable interval; by default this is 60 times per second.</p>

      <remarks>      
      <p>
      The CreateResources event is raised once when the CanvasControl is first initialized, then
      again any time the resources need to be recreated, for instance if the graphics device is lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your app cannot be structured in a way where it loads all of its resources
        at the beginning (for example, a game with multiple levels, and the levels require
        different assets), see <a href="LoadingResourcesOutsideCreateResources.htm">Loading Resources outside of CreateResources</a>

      <summary>This is where the magic happens! Hook this event to issue your immediate mode 2D drawing calls.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>The Draw event is raised once when the CanvasControl first becomes visible, then again
           any time its contents need to be redrawn. This can occur, for example, if the control is resized.
           You can manually trigger a Draw event yourself by calling
           <see cref="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasControl.Invalidate"/>.

        <p>If you want to animate the contents of a CanvasControl, you should use

      <summary>The color that the control is cleared to before the Draw event is raised.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          ClearColor defaults to transparent black, that is, Color.FromArgb(0,0,0,0).
        </p>
        <p>
          Modifying ClearColor will cause the control to redraw, as if
          Invalidate() was called.
        </p>
        <p>
          CanvasControl uses this ClearColor property instead of the Background property 
          that is inherited from XAML UserControl, because Background can be set to any 
          XAML brush object. It does not make sense to clear an immediate mode Win2D 
          control using XAML content as the background, so CanvasControl ignores the XAML 
          Background setting.

      <remarks>
        <p>
          When using this control from managed code it is necessary to ensure
          that all references to it are released, otherwise it will not get
          garbage collected correctly.  To do this, call RemoveFromVisualTree
          from the Unloaded event handler of the page that the control was on
          and then release any explicit references to it.

        <p>Using TrackAsyncAction will:</p>

        <p>
          In the current implementation, only one action can be tracked at a
