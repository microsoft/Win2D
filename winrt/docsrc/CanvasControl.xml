      <summary>XAML control providing immediate mode 2D rendering. Start here if you are new to the Win2D API.</summary>
      <remarks>
        To get started using Win2D, simply add a CanvasControl to your XAML
        tree, subscribe to its CanvasControl.Draw event, and use the methods of
        CanvasDrawEventArgs.DrawingSession to draw your immediate mode 2D graphics.
      </remarks>
      <example>
        <p>Starting with the "Blank App" XAML project template, edit MainPage.xaml and add the namespace:</p>
        <code>
          xmlns:canvas="using:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas"
        </code>
        <p>Add a CanvasControl to the page:</p>
        <code>
          &lt;Grid&gt;
            &lt;canvas:CanvasControl x:Name="myWidget" CreateResources="myWidget_CreateResources" Draw="myWidget_Draw" ClearColor="CornFlowerBlue"/&gt;
          &lt;/Grid&gt;
        </code>
        <p>Edit MainPage.xaml.cs, and add some drawing code:</p>
        <code>
          public sealed partial class MainPage : Page
          {
              CanvasSolidColorBrush redBrush;

              public MainPage()
              {
                  this.InitializeComponent();
              }

              void myWidget_CreateResources(CanvasControl sender, CanvasCreateResourcesEventArgs args)
              {
                  // Create any resources needed by the Draw event handler.

                  // Asynchronous work can be tracked with TrackAsyncAction:
                  args.TrackAsyncAction(myWidget_CreateResourcesAsync(sender).AsAsyncAction());
              }

              async Task myWidget_CreateResourcesAsync(CanvasControl sender)
              {
                   // Load bitmaps, create brushes, etc.
                   bitmapTiget = await CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync(sender, "imageTiger.jpg");
              }

              void myWidget_Draw(CanvasControl sender, CanvasDrawEventArgs args)
              {
                  args.DrawingSession.DrawEllipse(155, 115, 80, 30, Colors.Black, 3);
                  args.DrawingSession.DrawText("Hello, world!", 100, 100, Colors.Yellow);
              }
          }

    <member name="M:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasControl.Invalidate">
      <summary>Indicates that the contents of the CanvasControl need to be redrawn.
               Calling Invalidate results in the Draw event being raised shortly afterward.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>Normally, the contents of a CanvasControl are drawn only once when it first becomes visible.
           If you want to change those contents, call Invalidate to tell the control it must redraw itself.</p>

        <p>This is a lightweight method, so it is reasonable to call it many times in rapid succession.
           High frequency calls to Invalidate will be merged, with the control only actually redrawing
           at a maximum of the display refresh rate. It will not redraw once for every Invalidate call
           if these are happening faster than the display can keep up.</p>

        <p>If you want to animate the contents of a CanvasControl, simply call Invalidate at the end of
           your Draw event handler. This will result in the control being redrawn over and over again.</p>

      <remarks>
        DPI describes the ratio between device independent pixels (dips) and actual physical pixels.
        The identity DPI value is 96, which means dips and pixels are the same.

      <remarks>The CreateResources event is raised once when the CanvasControl is first initialized, then
               again any time the resources need to be recreated, for instance if the underlying GPU gets reset.</remarks>

    <member name="E:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasControl.Draw">
      <summary>This is where the magic happens! Hook this event to issue your immediate mode 2D drawing calls.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>The Draw event is raised once when the CanvasControl first becomes visible, then again
           any time its contents need to be redrawn. This can occur if the control is resized, or in
           response to the Invalidate method being called.</p>
        
        <p>If you want to animate the contents of a CanvasControl, simply call Invalidate at the end of
           your Draw event handler. This will result in the control being redrawn over and over again,
           so you can draw different things each time.</p>

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasControl.ClearColor">
      <summary>The color that the control is cleared to before the Draw event is raised.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          ClearColor defaults to transparent black, that is Color.FromArgb(0,0,0,0).
        </p>
        <p>
          Modifying ClearColor will cause the control to redraw, as if
          Invalidate() was called.

      <remarks>
        <p>
          Use this when creating resources involves asynchronous method calls,
          such as <see cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync">CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync</see>.
        </p>

        {
            bitmapTiger = await CanvasBitmap.LoadAsync(sender, "imageTiger.jpg");
        }
        </code>
        <p>
          In the current implementation, only one action can be tracked at a
          time.  Attempting to track multiple actions simultaneously will cause
          TrackAsyncAction to throw an exception.
