      <summary>Gets or sets the device used by this image source.</summary>
      <remarks>
        Changing this property binds the image source to a different device.
        This is used after a new device is recovered after a device lost.

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasImageSource.Dpi">
      <summary>Gets the dots-per-inch (DPI) of this image source.</summary>
      <remarks>
        DPI describes the ratio between device independent pixels (dips) and actual physical pixels.
        The identity DPI value is 96, which means dips and pixels are the same.
