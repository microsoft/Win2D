      <summary>A swap chain is a series of buffers that can be drawn to and presented to the screen.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          Like a bitmap, a swap chain has a fixed with and height, and stores 2D
          information. Underlying this, however, it may consist of multiple
          buffers. For more information about native swap chains, see the
          documentation on <a
          href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb174569(v=vs.85).aspx">IDXGISwapChain</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two types of CanvasSwapChain are supported: composition and CoreWindow.
        </p>
        <h4>Composition (XAML) Swap Chains</h4>
        <p>
          Composition swap chains are constructed via <see
          cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain.#ctor"/> and are
          suitable for use in XAML apps.  These swap chains can be displayed
          using <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasSwapChainPanel"/>.
          <see cref="T:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.UI.Xaml.CanvasAnimatedControl"/> uses a
          composition swap chain internally.
          <code>
            var swapChain = new CanvasSwapChain(device, width, height, dpi);
            swapChainPanel.SwapChain = swapChain;
            // ... later ...
            swapChain.Present();
          </code>
        </p>
        <h4>CoreWindow Swap Chains</h4>
        <p>
          CoreWindow swap chains are constructed via <see
          cref="O:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.CanvasSwapChain.CreateForCoreWindow"/> and can only
          be used in non-XAML apps (also known as "DirectX apps".)
          <code>
            var swapChain = CanvasSwapChain.CreateForCoreWindow(device, coreWindow, dpi);
            // ... later ...
            swapChain.Present();
          </code>

      <summary>Specifies that only a subregion of the swap chain should be displayed.</summary>
      <remarks>
        <p>
          This property can be used to optimize rendering by only drawing to part of the swap chain, then
          scaling up that region to fill the same area that would normally have been covered by the entire
          swap chain. Because fewer pixels need to be written, this can reduce GPU rendering cost. The
          source size can be efficiently changed before every present, dynamically adjusting resolution
          to match the current rendering workload.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source size must be less than or equal to the size of the swap chain. When set to a smaller
          value, only the top left subregion of the swap chain will be displayed. Setting this property
          is functionally equivalent to using ResizeBuffers followed by TransformMatrix with a scale of
          originalSize / newSize, but changing the SourceSize is much more efficient than ResizeBuffers
          when you want to adjust resolution on the fly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The source size property only affects how the swap chain is displayed. You must separately use
          other drawing APIs to restrict your rendering to the specified top left region of the swap chain.

      <summary>Waits until the next vertical blank occurs on the display.</summary>
      <remarks>
      
      <p>
      A vertical blank on a display, such as a monitor, occurs when the monitor is ready
      to begin drawing the next frame. For many monitors this occurs every 1/60th of a second,
      or 60Hz. Because new imagery on a display cannot be seen with any finer granularity
      than that, many apps threshold their game loop to not iterate any more frequently 
      than vertical blank. An app's render thread may be able to save CPU usage by waiting 
      until the next vertical blank to process information or redraw, rather than busy-spin 
      for the correct time interval.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      WaitForVerticalBlank is designed to be a synchronous call in order to be as efficient 
      as possible. It blocks until the next vertical blank occurs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      If your app has multiple swap chains which will render on the same thread, and their
      behavior should be synchronized to vertical blank, only call WaitForVerticalBlank
      on <i>one</i> of the swap chains. The choice of which swap chain is arbitrary.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      If the device you used to create the swap chain had the ForceSoftwareRenderer
      option set to true, or 
      <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff476328%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">D3D_DRIVER_TYPE_WARP</a>
      (in the case of Direct3D interop), the display cannot be accessed to wait on vertical 
      blank. In that case, this method will relinquish the remainder of this thread's 
      time slice to any other thread that is ready to run.
