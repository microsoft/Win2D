      <summary>Defines a stroke style for drawing lines. Dashes, dots, how to join segments, how to cap the ends, etc.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets how the world transform, dots per inch (DPI), and stroke width affect the shape of the pen.</summary>

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasStrokeStyle.StartCap">
      <summary>Gets or sets the type of shape used at the beginning of a stroke. Defaults to Flat.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets the limit on the ratio of the miter length to half the stroke's thickness.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets the type of joint used at the vertices of a shape's outline.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets the type of shape used at the end of a stroke. Defaults to Flat.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets the stroke's dash pattern.
               This is ignored if <see cref="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasStrokeStyle.CustomDashStyle"/> has been set.</summary>

      <summary>Gets or sets how far into the dash sequence the stroke will start.</summary>

    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasStrokeStyle.DashCap">
      <summary>Gets or sets how the ends of each dash are drawn. Defaults to Square.
               If this is set to Flat, dots will have zero size so only dashes are visible.</summary>
    </member>
    <member name="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasStrokeStyle.CustomDashStyle">
      <summary>Gets or sets an array describing a custom dash pattern.
               This overrides the <see cref="P:Microsoft.Graphics.Canvas.Geometry.CanvasStrokeStyle.DashStyle"/>
               property, which is only used when CustomDashStyle is set to null.</summary>

      <remarks>
        <p>A custom dash style is an array whose elements specify the length of each dash and space in the pattern.
           The first element sets the length of a dash, the second element sets the length of a space,
           the third element sets the length of a dash, and so on. The length of each dash and space in
           the dash pattern is the product of the element value in the array and the stroke width.</p>
        <p>This array must contain an even number of elements.</p>
